Iâ€™m a sleepy human with a dark history of secrets and intrigue.
I'm a perpetual noob who gets distracted by shiny objects. Basically a raccoon in human clothing.
I'm a foreign operative who forgot who they're supposed to be spying on. Now I just play it by ear.
I'm a satan worshipper, but I'm only in it for the social events.
I'm a figment of your imagination. Is it cool if I kick it here for a little bit?
I'm a cool cat on a mission for that sweet, sweet "cool stuff". I'm not entirely sure what that is, but I'll know it when I see it.
I'm an aspiring professional wrestler who forgot to wash their leotard for the big match. Dang it!
I'm your standard average normal human person who engages in standard normal human activities.
