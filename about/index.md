## about me:
I'm a *cs student* with a dark history of secrets and intrigue! Currently, I am working on getting this site up and running with ssl certs, git frontends, and responsive design.
<br />
<br/>
I hack away in vim for the writing, tmux for the multiplexing, and emacs for that magit goodness.
<br/>
<br/>
Right now I'm running GalliumOS (Chromebook CB3-111), Arch (Thinkpad x230), and Void (Thinkpad x220).

## about the website:
I built this website as a way to store and present my various works and projects. The site itself owes it's beginnings to Jonathan McGlone's wonderfully helpful [guide](jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).
<br/>
<br/>
This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted on my Raspberry Pi (Raspbian on RPi3 Model B), and SSL encrypted/certified with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) and [Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/).
<br/>
<br/>
The [source code](https://github.com/lbeckman314/lbeckman314.github.io) for the website is yours. Feel free to copy and paste, fork, clone, or anything you like. Be forwarn! This site is written in an ungodly mix of markdown and html. To spin up your own site, simply follow [the jekyll quick-start quide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) (adapted below):

<br/>

```shell
# install ruby
# for OS-specific instructions, check out https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/

# Install Jekyll and Bundler gems through RubyGems
gem install jekyll bundler

# install dependencies
bundle install

# Create a new Jekyll site at ./myblog
jekyll new myblog

# alternatively, clone an existing jekyll site
# git clone https://liambeckman.com/cgit/website.git

# Change into your new directory
cd myblog

# Build the site on the preview server
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Now browse to http://localhost:4000

# then you can change the html/css files in your website directory (e.g. myblog/) to suit your tastes!
# some cool templates → https://html5up.net/

# hosting is a whole 'nother beast, but services like github pages and gitlab pages make free hosting relatively easier.
# self-hosting with apache and/or nginx is another cool possibility!

```
