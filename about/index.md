## about me:
I'm a *cs student* who loves making things! Currently, I am working on getting this site up and running with ssl certs, git frontends, and responsive design.
<br />
<br/>
I hack away in vim for the writing, tmux for the multiplexing, and emacs for that magit goodness.
<br/>
<br/>
Right now I'm running Arch (Thinkpad x230), GalliumOS (Acer Chromebook cb3-111), and Raspbian (Raspberry Pi 3 B+).

## about the website:
I built this website as a way to store and present my various works and projects. The site itself owes it's beginnings to Jonathan McGlone's wonderfully helpful [guide](jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).
<br/>
<br/>
This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on my Raspberry Pi.
