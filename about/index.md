## about the website:    
I built this website as a way to store and present my various works and projects. The site itself owes it's beginnings to Jonathan McGlone's wonderfully helpful guide [jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/](jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).

This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
