## about the website:    
I built this website as a way to store and present my various works and projects. The site itself owes it's beginnings to Jonathan McGlone's [	wonderfully helpful guide](jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).

This website is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted by [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/lbeckman314/lbeckman314.github.io)!

## to do:
* transfer domain name from google to porkbun (just to add some support for a smaller, oregon-based buisness)
* transfer hosting from github's servers to my own (running apache (or nginx) and certbot for that sweet opensource HTTPS certs!)
* implement sass to help make the css a bit more managable
* clean up site of any weird artifacts
