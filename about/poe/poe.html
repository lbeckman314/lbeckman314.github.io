<pre><code>Phil asked for a young strapping bachelor
with gallantry and poise both imbued
but none were available tonight
so...I&#39;ll have to do.


an honor it is to toast the lassies
with a little help from the Bard,
The lassies that keep us close today.
Aye, the lassie o&#39; our hearts.


And though may they put up with us messy boars
and temper our uncouth ways
They do so with a wealth of love
and far too little praise.


Though Burn&#39;s himself skirted and flirted
and romanced through the land
He loved the lassies true enough
For they have our hearts, they have our hands. 


He knew it to be true,
He knew it to be thus
for though we may have a great many things,
The love of a highland lassie is a definite must.



And while we face life&#39;s great toils
woes and foes aplenty
we face them with their love sweetly given
a love gladly shared with thee


And still today and into the morror
they stand with us in happiness and sorrow.

Thus it is withoyut reservation
with warm homes and full elation
that we give the lassies their due celebration
on behalf of the great Scottish nation.





Till a’ the seas gang dry, my dear,
   And the rocks melt wi’ the sun;
We will love thee still, my dear,
   While the sands o’ life shall run.

and tho we fancy the ale, and haggis too
    our true love will always be thee.</code></pre>
