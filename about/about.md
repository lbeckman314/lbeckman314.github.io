Hello there! 

The projects you see on this website are made by me, with lots love~~

I like to create things that help people, primarily by making education more accessible. Whether by sharing knowledge and opportunities with those living in rural environments, or those living in low socioeconomic situations, I believe that computers and the internet have the potential to make an impact for good in the lives of many.

So much of my respect for programming in general is that it remains so open and inclusive to anyone from any background. Many if not most of the tools a programmer requires are free (as in free beer and free as in freedom!) and tutorials abound for many of the concepts and principles of programming. So if one were curious at all about coding, all they need is a computer, an internet connection, and a desire to give it a shot. Like the thing with feathers in Emily Dickinson's beautiful poem*, coding will provide a world of opportunity and "Yet - never - in Extremity, / It asked a crumb - of me."
