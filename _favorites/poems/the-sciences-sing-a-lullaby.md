*Physics says:* go to sleep. Of course
you're tired. Every atom in you
has been dancing the shimmy in silver shoes
nonstop from mitosis to now.
Quit tapping your feet. They'll dance
inside themselves without you. Go to sleep.

*Geology says:* it will be all right. Slow inch
by inch America is giving itself
to the ocean. Go to sleep. Let darkness
lap at your sides. Give darkness an inch.
You aren't alone. All of the continents used to be
one body. You aren't alone. Go to sleep.

*Astronomy says:* the sun will rise tomorrow,
*Zoology says:* on rainbow-fish and lithe gazelle,
*Psychology says:* but first it has to be night, so
*Biology says:* the body-clocks are stopped all over town
and
*History says:* here are the blankets, layer on layer, down and down.
