## about the website:

This website stores and presents various projects!

It originally got up and running thanks to Jonathan McGlone's [guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).

This site has gone through a couple iterations (all available on [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/30000000000000*/liambeckman.com)), from being built with Jekyll and self-hosted on a trusty Thinkpad x230 running Debian, to now where it's built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The [website's source code](https://github.com/lbeckman314/website) is yours.

Feel free to copy and paste, fork, clone, or anything you like!

To spin up your own site, follow [the Astro tutotial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/1/) (adapted below) —

```sh
# Install dependencies
➜ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash

➜ source ~/{.zshrc,.bashrc}

➜ nvm install node

➜ git clone https://github.com/lbeckman314/lbeckman314.github.io

➜ cd lbeckman314.github.io

➜ npm astro dev

# Now browse to http://localhost:3000

# Then you can change the html/css files in your website directory (e.g. src/styles/main.scss) to suit your tastes!

# Hosting is a whole 'nother beast, but services like GitHub Pages make free hosting relatively easier.

# Self-hosting with Apache and/or Nginx is another cool possibility!

# TODO: Add additional resources/steps for hosting (i.e. how is this site hosted?)
```
