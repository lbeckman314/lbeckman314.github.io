The Sea Shell
By Marin Sorescu
Translated by Michael Hamburger

~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~ * ~

I have hidden inside a sea shell
but forgotten in which.

Now daily I dive,
filtering the sea through my fingers,
to find myself.
Sometimes I think
a giant fish has swallowed me.
Looking for it everywhere I want to make sure
it will get me completely.

The sea-bed attracts me, and
I'm repelled by millions
of sea shells that all look alike.
Help, I am one of them.
If only I knew, which.

How often I've gone straight up
to one of them, saying: That’s me.
Only, when I prised it open
it was empty.



There is no Frigate like a Book (1286)
By Emily Dickinson

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

There is no Frigate like a Book
To take us Lands away
Nor any Coursers like a Page
Of prancing Poetry –
This Traverse may the poorest take
Without oppress of Toll –
How frugal is the Chariot
That bears the Human Soul –

Summer at North Farm
By Stephen Kuusisto

Finnish rural life, ca. 1910

Fires, always fires after midnight,
the sun depending in the purple birches

and gleaming like a copper kettle.
By the solstice they’d burned everything,

the bad-luck sleigh, a twisted rocker,
things “possessed” and not-quite-right.

The bonfire coils and lurches,
big as a house, and then it settles.

The dancers come, dressed like rainbows
(if rainbows could be spun),

and linking hands they turn
to the melancholy fiddles.

A red bird spreads its wings now
and in the darker days to come.

/for my mother/

They are fleeting.
They are fragile.
They require

little water.
They'll surprise you.
They'll remind you

that they aren't
and they are you.

Illustration of Recursion
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/126756/examples-of-recursive-functions/126785#126785

A CS professor once explained recursion as follows:
A child couldn't sleep, so her mother told her a story about a little frog,
    who couldn't sleep, so the frog's mother told her a story about a little bear,
         who couldn't sleep, so the bear's mother told her a story about a little weasel...
            who fell asleep.
        ...and the little bear fell asleep;
    ...and the little frog fell asleep;
...and the child fell asleep.








This Week's Poem:
Point by Point
by 19th Iranian poet Táhirih (Qurratu l-ʿAyn)
http://www.tahirihthepureone.com/PointByPoint.php

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

If I met you face to face, I
would retrace—erase!—my heartbreak,
    pain by pain,
    ache by ache,
    word by word,
    point by point.
In search of you—just your face!—I
roam through the streets lost in disgrace,
    house to house,
    lane to lane,
    place to place,
    door to door.
My heart hopeless—broken,crushed!—I
heard it pound, till blood gushed from me,
    fountain by fountain,
    stream by stream,
    river by river,
    sea by sea.
The garden of your lips—your cheeks!—
your perfumed hair, I wonder there,
    bloom to bloom,
    rose to rose,
    petal to petal,
    scent to scent.
Your eyebrow—your eye!—and the mole
on your face, somehow they tie me,
    trait to trait,
    kindness to kindness,
    passion to passion,
    love to love.
While I grieve, with love—your love!—I
will reweave the fabric of my soul,
    stitch by stitch,
    thread by thread,
    warp by warp,
    woof by woof.
Last, I—Tahirih—searched my heart, I
looked line by line. What did I find?
    You and you,
    you and you,
    you and you.




Recursion

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

A tomato I overlooked on the window ledge,
remembers the hold of vine, the brace of ground,
and puts down roots inside its own flesh.

Halved under the blade of my knife,
the tomato unbinds its shoots, sends them
into an abyss of air and light—

Here at my desk I sit remembering,
putting down words far from the vine
of a native tongue, as if they could be roots,

each, like the tomato with its faith curlicues
in pale inward shoots, calling to itself,
back to the source of fruit.






The Tea and Sage Poem
https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/54517/the-tea-and-sage-poem

by Fady Joudah

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

At a desk made of glass,
In a glass walled-room
With red airport carpet,

An officer asked
My father for fingerprints,
And my father refused,

So another offered him tea
And he sipped it. The teacup
Template for fingerprints.

My father says, it was just
Hot water with a bag.
My father says, in his country,

Because the earth knows
The scent of history,
It gave the people sage.

I like my tea with sage
From my mother’s garden,
Next to the snapdragons

She calls fishmouths
Coming out for air. A remedy
For stomach pains she keeps

In the kitchen where
She always sings.
First, she is Hagar

Boiling water
Where tea is loosened.
Then she drops

In it a pinch of sage
And lets it sit a while.
She tells a story:

The groom arrives late
To his wedding
Wearing only one shoe.

The bride asks him
About the shoe. He tells her
He lost it while jumping

Over a house-wall.
Breaking away from soldiers.
She asks:

Tea with sage
Or tea with mint?

With sage, he says,
Sweet scent, bitter tongue.
She makes it, he drinks.




THE SHAPE OF THINGS
by Terence P. Paré
https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/browse?contentId=36254
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
In high school,
I learned to shape opinions
into squares:
the building blocks
of matter,
of life,
of history—
stackable, storable, neat
like Tupperware,
I made a world of toys.

In college,
I learned in circles
(a rounded education):
the Platonic sphere,
the cycles of things,
Hegel's spiral,
I squeezed the universe into a ball,
rolled it toward the overwhelming question,
and it rolled right back again,
undisturbed.

These days, I think
in wavy lines and arcs:
the koala bear's opposable thumb,
a lick of moon, the sleeping cat,
my lover's hair spilled over the pillow;
sloppy fluid things
that don't add up—
tigers in the snow!
Chaotic, mostly living,
they'll die
or burst from time to time
like stars.





"Assembly" by Albert Goldmsith
        &
"A Hum" by Albert Goldsmith

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~**~*~

ASSEMBLY

That the wild call of water is a mystery but
the dowser's switch is a recognized, uniform y.
That even the honeymoon night in its passion rests
�just ask the home goods store�on a registered pattern.
This explains why though the inspiration is savage,
brief, and forked through with the numinous,
the poet is found minutely assembling a sonnet.
When the word of God came down from the mountain
it came in the same carved alphabet
of local treatises: regimented shapes. And
when the voice of God itself requires one more
avid listener for it sky-wide storm . . .
In some womb just now, the formal
bones of the middle ear are appearing.


~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~**~*~

A HUM

Now: sun through the blinds.
The stave it makes.
And then the first notes of birdsong.

                �

You asleep in my arms.
And in my head: some music, a popular tune.
And in it: somebody earlier. Somebody else.

                �

I'm speaking of the way an old song is a stone
with a fossil inside. It's not your fault:
keep sleeping. Just sleep while I hum.

“I Broke the Spell That Held Me Long”
By William Cullen Bryant
https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/55286/i-broke-the-spell-that-held-me-long

I broke the spell that held me long,
The dear, dear witchery of song.
I said, the poet’s idle lore
Shall waste my prime of years no more,
For Poetry, though heavenly born,
Consorts with poverty and scorn.

I broke the spell–nor deemed its power
Could fetter me another hour.
Ah, thoughtless! how could I forget
Its causes were around me yet?
For wheresoe’er I looked, the while,
Was Nature’s everlasting smile.

Still came and lingered on my sight
Of flowers and streams the bloom and light,
And glory of the stars and sun; –
And these and poetry are one.
They, ere the world had held me long,
Recalled me to the love of song.






The Hummingbird Nest
By Pascale Petit

https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/90283/the-hummingbird-nest

I bring you a hummingbird’s nest, woven
from seed-down, thistle head,

bound with lichen and spidersilk,
shaped by a mother who presses her breast

against the cup, uses her rump, chin,
the curve of her wing, who stomps

her claws on the base to check it’s
windproof under this leaf porch.

The male gone, she works alone,
hurrying back and forth thirty times

an hour, before the eggs come.
She lays them in a home small as a nutshell,

the rim turned in, the sides pliant
so they’ll stretch as the chicks grow.

Little mother, I’ve read your file
filled with letters to the mairie, begging

for a place where we could live together.
I know now how hard you fought the powers,

like a jeweled dart stabbing at their door,
before you fell prey to the jungle mantis.

Instead of flowers, I leave you this nest
on your grave, in case you make it

from your migration — only a wisp
of feathers, no flesh left on your bones.

[My prime of youth is but a frost of cares]
By Chidiock Tichborne

My prime of youth is but a frost of cares,
My feast of joy is but a dish of pain,
My crop of corn is but a field of tares,
And all my good is but vain hope of gain.
The day is gone and yet I saw no sun,
And now I live, and now my life is done.

The spring is past, and yet it hath not sprung,
The fruit is dead, and yet the leaves are green,
My youth is gone, and yet I am but young,
I saw the world, and yet I was not seen,
My thread is cut, and yet it was not spun,
And now I live, and now my life is done.

I sought my death and found it in my womb,
I lookt for life and saw it was a shade,
I trode the earth and knew it was my tomb,
And now I die, and now I am but made.
The glass is full, and now the glass is run,
And now I live, and now my life is done.

Notes

II

Where go the birds when the rain
Roars and sweeps and fells the grain,
When tortured trees groan with pain,
And the storm-worn night is old—
Driven forth from their slumbr cold,
Where go the birds?
