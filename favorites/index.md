    <p>※ <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/51021/the-sea-shell">The Sea Shell</a> By Marin Sorescu, Translated by Michael Hamburger </p>

    <pre>
    I have hidden inside a sea shell
    but forgotten in which.

    Now daily I dive,
    filtering the sea through my fingers,
    to find myself.
    Sometimes I think
    a giant fish has swallowed me.
    Looking for it everywhere I want to make sure
    it will get me completely.

    The sea-bed attracts me, and
    I'm repelled by millions
    of sea shells that all look alike.
    Help, I am one of them.
    If only I knew, which.

    How often I've gone straight up
    to one of them, saying: That’s me.
    Only, when I prised it open
    it was empty.

    Summer at North Farm
    By Stephen Kuusisto

    Finnish rural life, ca. 1910

    Fires, always fires after midnight,
    the sun depending in the purple birches

    and gleaming like a copper kettle.
    By the solstice they’d burned everything,

    the bad-luck sleigh, a twisted rocker,
    things “possessed” and not-quite-right.

    The bonfire coils and lurches,
    big as a house, and then it settles.

    The dancers come, dressed like rainbows
    (if rainbows could be spun),

    and linking hands they turn
    to the melancholy fiddles.

    A red bird spreads its wings now
    and in the darker days to come.

    /for my mother/

    They are fleeting.
    They are fragile.
    They require

    little water.
    They'll surprise you.
    They'll remind you

    that they aren't
    and they are you.

    <pre>

    A CS professor once explained recursion as follows:
    A child couldn't sleep, so her mother told her a story about a little frog,
        who couldn't sleep, so the frog's mother told her a story about a little bear,
            who couldn't sleep, so the bear's mother told her a story about a little weasel...
                who fell asleep.
                ...and the little bear fell asleep;
            ...and the little frog fell asleep;
    ...and the child fell asleep.

    <pre>

    If I met you face to face, I
    would retrace—erase!—my heartbreak,
        pain by pain,
        ache by ache,
        word by word,
        point by point.
    In search of you—just your face!—I
    roam through the streets lost in disgrace,
        house to house,
        lane to lane,
        place to place,
        door to door.
    My heart hopeless—broken,crushed!—I
    heard it pound, till blood gushed from me,
        fountain by fountain,
        stream by stream,
        river by river,
        sea by sea.
    The garden of your lips—your cheeks!—
    your perfumed hair, I wonder there,
        bloom to bloom,
        rose to rose,
        petal to petal,
        scent to scent.
    Your eyebrow—your eye!—and the mole
    on your face, somehow they tie me,
        trait to trait,
        kindness to kindness,
        passion to passion,
        love to love.
    While I grieve, with love—your love!—I
    will reweave the fabric of my soul,
        stitch by stitch,
        thread by thread,
        warp by warp,
        woof by woof.
    Last, I—Tahirih—searched my heart, I
    looked line by line. What did I find?
        You and you,
        you and you,
        you and you.

    <pre>
    A tomato I overlooked on the window ledge,
    remembers the hold of vine, the brace of ground,
    and puts down roots inside its own flesh.

    Halved under the blade of my knife,
    the tomato unbinds its shoots, sends them
    into an abyss of air and light—

    Here at my desk I sit remembering,
    putting down words far from the vine
    of a native tongue, as if they could be roots,

    each, like the tomato with its faith curlicues
    in pale inward shoots, calling to itself,
    back to the source of fruit.

    <p>※ <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/54517/the-tea-and-sage-poem"> The Tea and Sage Poem</a> by Fady Joudah</p>

    <pre>
    At a desk made of glass,
    In a glass walled-room
    With red airport carpet,

    An officer asked
    My father for fingerprints,
    And my father refused,

    So another offered him tea
    And he sipped it. The teacup
    Template for fingerprints.

    My father says, it was just
    Hot water with a bag.
    My father says, in his country,

    Because the earth knows
    The scent of history,
    It gave the people sage.

    I like my tea with sage
    From my mother’s garden,
    Next to the snapdragons

    She calls fishmouths
    Coming out for air. A remedy
    For stomach pains she keeps

    In the kitchen where
    She always sings.
    First, she is Hagar

    Boiling water
    Where tea is loosened.
    Then she drops

    In it a pinch of sage
    And lets it sit a while.
    She tells a story:

    The groom arrives late
    To his wedding
    Wearing only one shoe.

    The bride asks him
    About the shoe. He tells her
    He lost it while jumping

    Over a house-wall.
    Breaking away from soldiers.
    She asks:

    Tea with sage
    Or tea with mint?

    With sage, he says,
    Sweet scent, bitter tongue.
    She makes it, he drinks.
