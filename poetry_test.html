<p>When the words will not appear, type out the ltters ,and let them form themselves, into the shapes they want, the shapes that ellude you and bind you in the dark</p>
<p>Without a friend in the world, ask for ink and paper, and all will be good, for who are you but one dazzled by lights and music that you couldn't (see &amp;) hear (deep) in the dark.</p>
<p>And while you attend the dances, pray put in a kind word for me, and ask the master to forgive my tresspasses on his grounds, for you see. I was cold out in the dark.</p>
<p>A Monster! O! A Monster (Approaches)!</p>
<p>You told to me to look towards the north From wence I would find my only course</p>
<p>I would not look,I was frightened so Of the beings that sing from the depts below</p>
<p>'Neath the ice and in the black, they whisper behind your back Turn around and you will see, naught but the cold staring back at thee</p>
<p>So you must never venture forth into these lands, For they belong to the shivering, desolate, sorry man.</p>
<p>Night Terrors (afraid of the water)</p>
<p>The wolves run heavy over my (broken, mortal) body their claws cut deep as they run to their cubs, their caves to sleep. What lovely creatures, I think as I find my nightly home. That bless'd, starry bed, look at how they roam!</p>
<p>Looking down from a slumber</p>
<p>We are clockwork you and I clockwork until the day we die.</p>
<p>Watch us dance and fly across the room in a uniformed coordination Ticking so elegantly; arcs of pronounced stand - ard - i - za - tion We begin and end with a tick and a tock of the clock on the wall until we fall.</p>
<p>But the (fundamental) difference between you and I are our hands. The hands that have given us so much pain the hands that skip and wane and fall behind tempo of our perfectly timed tango and oh! how that burns.</p>
<p>Why is this? It is because you are the minute and I am the hour. We meet in the middle -- O! how sour -- four and twenty times a day and yet only agree twice (and I say:) (in our way.) You are so much faster than I, in all walks, in how you talk to others and balk at brothers and galk at lovers. O! O. O... A tick and a tock and then we drop. A tick and a tock.</p>
<p>Let us stop for now, and enjoy what time we have.</p>
<p>Dancing all around</p>
<p>&quot;frek&quot; on a rock -- a nordic warning of monsters nearby.</p>
<p>WHen I ener your life, you will know: recognize me as the alcoholic recently sober, the lover who chose poorly. I am the addict's realization the hopeful's resignation.</p>
<p>frek</p>
<p>My last love stepped off the bus and onto the walk with/among so many (people) I did not know whom I recognized not</p>
<p>And yet what lives do they lead that I miss out on? with their own losses and triumphs are they heroes or not?</p>
<p>The answer should be obvious, last love, like you like a tempest that freezes the skin and you remember not</p>
<p>the touch of summer on tender bodies, in the wake of waves and seabreeze that so solemnly<br />
wash the flesh and not</p>
<p>The mind, the raking of your voice, last love, leads and beckons to the end, away from all yet these others know not</p>
<p>The danger of you, last love, nor I their last loves, shall we keep these secrets to ourselves forever safe: trust not</p>
<p>the ones who reveal any minuate of your cruelty and you will walk past, like a tiger with enough meat for now.</p>
<p>&quot;Beyond your maw&quot;</p>
<p>My love, I wonder what you would say to me now after spending a lifetime together A lifetime of love and belonging. What would you say to my lonely self.</p>
<p>Say that we loved eachother and cared above all else for eachother that we were happy and beautiful together. Whicper to me that all will be well and hold me in your arms, my love, becuse I am so afraid that we will never be, that we will never find one</p>
<p>another. I want so much to be with you for all th years ahead.</p>
<p>What would you say to me now. Let me know that I loved and was loved by the most wonderful friend I could</p>
<p>ever have. I love you with all my heart, my love, my love.</p>
<p>You silly boy; I do not care that you fall short in your perfections, and I ask: will you fail (fall) again, as a flower blooms too late in the season and wilts at the first frost never blossoming, closed forever.</p>
<p>You shy boy; the bees may care if they cannot plunder your pollen, buzzing away for the sweater meadows but I am not a bee, so I may freely fly to wherever I choose: and the flowers all beckon in such lovely ways, their shimmering forms all multiply when I pass by, held aloft by the brazen sun; watch as I create constellations of amber spectrum'd fires, all. (“)Sing a song of rapture and melancholy, my buds, with the heights of all joy and the depths of all sadness.(“) And yet, do my crowd'd flowers obey?</p>
<p>No, my boy; they fall so deathly silent, for they know not the words I speak the desires I feel the needs I whisper in so lost and fruitless a manner to the speckl'd blossoms and their color'd, flying, strip'd friends So you find me wandering,</p>
<p>Sly boy, you who ly alone, blushing by yourself with every caress of the wind, closed off from the kiss of the rain and the (embrace) cradle of the leaf; falling as a memory of grace. But to you it is just a shameful reminder of all that could have been of all the affection that you missed in your years of isolation and that you think will never come to fruition.</p>
<p>Lovey, lonely boy; May i be your Spring? May i warm your blood and blushen your face? May we revel in the lengthening sunlight and love eternal in the comforting nights? Sing for me the songs i so wish to hear, and watch as we shake the time from the twilight and the light from the dawn. Let us ly, and watch now for the setting of the constellations, as they the flowers close their arms, bracing for the coldness ahead, observe now the bees as they return to their nests, satitated and satisfied. Who are we but the lonesome pair at the edge of the (our) world (Paradise)? With your embrace and mine finding eachother for the warmth of all the lifetimes ahead. (the other).</p>
<p>Home and Hearth</p>
<p>Why do I rember you and the evenings we shared in so many years of happness?</p>
<p>Along the coastlines rushed the clouds that we escaped, and the simple rain we enjoyed for those few weeks we had to eachother. The rocks in the ocean grew collasol over our heads, smoothed and shimmering (sheer) How then did we last for as long as we did, when so much forced us apart again and again.</p>
<p>Why then do I remember you, the face that you stole from my hands, my marble? The nape I desired in such a fashion as to fit you exactly. Tell me of the movemnets you danced along the surf, wirh you and the mist as partners, and footprints as the only record of our Love, You were dressed, I recall, in a dress of cotton, so close in shade to the colness ofthe sea with the feel of you so close to my skin.</p>
<p>How then did we end, you and I? FOr we were all the same, you and I. As an echo of one another reverberates and magnifis the sweat and dust/sweat dust surrounding us on our pale, light, sweet blue Earth.</p>
<p>My Galatea (castles)</p>
<p>What do you see when you see a child a woman a man? I see a library millenia in the making, written by a series of artists who crafted the most beautiful works in the Universe.</p>
<p>As they wrote symphonies to last as the stars fade and beckon: As Authors spilling ink across the seas; as painters throwing dyes through the lands; as musicians weaving chords and notes among the skies; as dancers spinning shadows towards the heavens...</p>
<p>Flames of craftmanship tearing apart, breaking the Earthen plates underfoot realeasing pain among the fractured shards of olympian scultpures, as it forms and reforms the image of it's desire: it's consuming and frenzy'd wickedness to last--to be remebered, for no other reason but that it can, that it molds and shakes the eternal bars of granite/abiotic stillness summoning and seperating life and death, the lovers who wish to be together for the eons of all, forcing all who choose to live, to lie again in the arms of darkness, asleep until the time comes, that these two titans may lie as one, when the galaxies spin no more, it will be the time of the breathless, in an</p>
<p>age of silence.</p>
<p>Hello tree , what a lovely gown you are wearing, let us dance across the room</p>
<p>(poem series)</p>
<p>It begins to snow in the classroom and I turn to go</p>
<p>Passing students taking no notice of the crystalline webs falling from the sky.</p>
<p>Outside, the tall pines blossom like flowers from the icy foundations below</p>
<p>On my command, the winds race and curve/curl above as a warmth slithers through my limbs And the wide sleep approaches again as a tall man with gentle arms</p>
<p>unconditional unanswerable</p>
<p>He strikes a fire while the trembling clouds dance and the treetops hide in the mist</p>
<p>I lament and confess to him my fears and guilts Under the day’s gathering/multivariate greyness (with shades) of industrial steel and laundered linen Meeting thundercloud fierceness and springtime meekness.</p>
<p>The sky’s brightness burns into darkness and the fire leaps and traipses in a thousand symmetrical flowers centered on the man and me While he sings forgiveness and the stars descend and caress, surrounding<br />
as wild fireflies standing eternal in the equinox of my creation.</p>
<p>Tell me about the times when we would stay up late to watch the stars and we’d feel special for having found eachother when the lights above were so separate and the air so cold and distant Yet here we lay, in eachother’s tiredness and embrace making time for one another because we enjoyed our company above all else. Tell me about the places we would go visiting towns and lights entirely foreign just to feel the sameness we’d grown the familiar, the lasting and unchanging. And when we grew old and tired, that’s what you remained to me--though all the fears and nights and troubles and stars strewn over the changing skies</p>
<p>You were my home You were my lasting.</p>
<p>“Time and Space”</p>
<p>What does it sound like to you when you brush your hair behind your ear? The forgiving wing on warm leaves? The whisper of whiskers wishing only to please? The sigh of linen bearing the fullness of a body? What does it sound like?</p>
<p>Let it remain a world of grains, sand and wheat and all things (pleasant and lasting) lasting and plesant falling across, curving beyond an eclipse</p>
<p>For one of the things you are to me-- a heart of eden an amber radiance a forgotten world.</p>
<p>“Shy Behaviors”</p>
<p>Good evening cherry tree, how lovely you dance/play in the light of our summer moon. as/with your wind-touched blossoms enchant/(ing) all Bringing that O! So lustful shade to the faces of your admirers and how, (may I say,) you transfix their blood with desire suits you quite well. For are you not such a lover, in the springtimes of May, as in the snowfalls of December. And yet are you not afraid of losing your color when the cold and night arrive? Such would petrify me, as it must surely petrify all who live so long. But with you, such fear is not elicited. Why, may I ask. Why are you so calm on the eve of the fall of grace?</p>
<p>Who are you? I am the one man battlefield the hunter and hunted together at last till Dusk we part and Dawn we meet. While the siege I seek for the harrowed soldier comes at last in the hallowed smolder of a time begotten and a people forgotten. And so all that is left all that may be found is the sole and weary’d beaten beathen down.</p>
<p>You tell me it's time to go, and I couldn't agree more. For you see,</p>
<p>I was young once, wasn't i? I was beautiful and naive and free to roam this world, untethered and unfearing, With those lovers that stole my kisses. Will they remember me still, after all this time? Would they recognize my face? My heart that lusted and comforted in equal measure.</p>
<p>I remember them all, as I remember yesterday slip away from my grasp as I cry for it to stay, because I cannot live without my yesterdays for I have no tomorrows left. I am old. I am older still.</p>
<p>And all those moments of a life, so little and O! so perfect, that collected on my windowsill for me to gaze at and remember, portraits of a life lived and a time shared. They will leave me too, and so I say (to you)(,): How I leave now, is not for you to decide, but for me to tell:</p>
<p>I leave with a world of woe behind me and the stars of sorrow ahead.</p>
<p>Kevin for God's sakes, your sister's recital starts at 5 and it's 4:56. Turn off your video game and get in the car!</p>
<p>&quot;The Age of Angst&quot; -Kevin, Age 6</p>
<p>For the Days Ahead...</p>
<p>Listening to my boy play like the sons of our past, our yesterdays that last</p>
<p>As we conquer’d and lost As we broke and fought among foreign lands and crimson sands</p>
<p>Having you by my side in those stranger times when we marched and charg’d and sang our call into the wind-stripp’d night for the death of all.</p>
<p>We were never meant to see the end of those days</p>
<p>And still we stayed. In the forests and in the fires we reigned.</p>
<p>Yet without you, where would I be frozen among the mud, under the stars supreme crying for home lost for the lights were gone, and I could not see my way.</p>
<p>But you were where to see us through you kept us warm and steadied our blood</p>
<p>Under the exploding sky I took shelter by you.</p>
<p>And there I will stay, for all seasons to march us by. With you I will stay.</p>
<p>Watch us, brother: Young and breathless, laughing at the falling sun and calling for the girls we will meet when we find our way back home.</p>
<p>...and Every Day Since</p>
<p>&quot;When you have nothing, /that's/ when you're rich! You have nothing they can take away from you, everything you have is your and yours alone. When the lights fall on you, and the eyes start wathcing you, /then/. Then you are in their debt. And the only day you stop being in their debt is the day you die. The best day of your life, unless you're poor, in which case you're rich.&quot; &quot;Thanks, Peter. That's quite...special.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No problem kid. You just remeber all that while you do whatever you do down there. It's a long way to Fresno, so don't expect no visits or nothin'.&quot; &quot;That's alright. You take care of yourself though.&quot; &quot;Take care of myself? Whatta mean? You tryin' to kick me out? I'm staying here now, seein' that you're movin' out and leavin' 'n all.&quot; &quot;You're staying in my room? With my mom and dad?&quot; &quot;Well, I expect I'll be spending most of the week at work, doing what I do best...&quot; &quot;What is that exactly?&quot; &quot;...and so I'll just be sleeping here every now and then.&quot;</p>
<p>raindrops fall in the uatumn air to the beat of one who may well fare to send the earthen messeage a tome &quot;Cast me off and warm my home&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Bring me the crown&quot; I say to you, my servant &quot;With her head attached!&quot; as you rush out.</p>
<p>I sit back and worry, that I've toppled a kingdom, by letting her rise in the land of death.</p>
<p>From the one alone in a forgotten land, to the master, commander, lord of us all. I loved her as a brother, (as only one can) as a friend, this lonely, wicked, tooth'd maul.</p>
<p>The world is dying, and yet still I must sing for to cry out into the dark is a wonderful thing To scream, to yell, to teem and tell the dark you still stand For while I can, for all who won't, I will hold this promised land.</p>
<p>You told to me to look towards the north From wence I would find my only course</p>
<p>I would not look,I was frightened so Of the beings that sing from the depts below</p>
<p>'Neath the ice and in the black, they whisper behind your back Turn around and you will see, naught but the cold staring back at thee</p>
<p>So you must never venture forth into these lands, For they belong to the shivering, desolate, sorry man.</p>
<p>Night Terrors (afraid of the water)</p>
<p>The wolves run heavy over my (broken, mortal) body their claws cut deep as they run to their cubs, their caves to sleep. What lovely creatures, I think as I find my nightly home. That bless'd, starry bed, look at how they roam!</p>
<p>Looking down from a slumber</p>
<p>What does regret do to one's soul, But to make him wail and cry Tearing and digging a coffin hole As he asks &quot;Why didn't I?&quot;</p>
<p>While it be too little too late (to change much) I do hereby promise, gladly to write my listing of actions fate So I, as old as I may be,</p>
<p>He holds the list close to him for the next time around</p>
<p>Run to me and I'll hold you close ye wicked soul of malice Tho your heart be iced, sliced, &amp; calloused, from thee I'll never part until days be dark and nights be light, shall I harken unto thee as thy turpid (turbid), turged, (flight) growth</p>
