```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    return 0;
}
```

I built this website as a way to store and present my various works and projects. The site itself owes it's beginnings to Jonathan McGlone's wonderfully helpful guide [jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/](jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). Over time I have incorporated other features based on my designs and that of others (while crediting such designs as much as possible). My biggest inspiration has so far been Minna Sundberg's breathtaking site for her comic [Stand Still Stay Silent](https://sssscomic.com).
