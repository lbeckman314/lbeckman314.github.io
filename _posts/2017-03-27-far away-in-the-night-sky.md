# far away in the night sky

```
Far away in the night sky
past the moon and past our stars
our among the oldest & coldest corners of the Universe
exits a lone, small star.
And around that star
orbits a lone, small planet.
On this planet lies a tiny creature,
no bigger than a pebble, who sleeps day in and day out
for every day of the year, save one.

While it sleeps, it dreams of a far-away
world where strange beings make music and tell stories
and dance together at night and work and play together in the day.
In it's dreams, this far-away world has colors
and sights and even smells unlike anywhere else.
The tiny creature enjoys dreaming warm dreams
about this wonderful & strange world. 

And on the one day it wakes to stretch it's small legs,
this tiny creature crawls out of it's burrow
out onto the open planet
& enjoys feeling the light of the lone, small star on it's body. 
And when it's time to go to sleep again,
one of the last things it does is ask the stars
to send their warmest light to that strange, far-away planet
and to the strange, beautiful beings that call that planet home.

In one of the most enchanting coincidences of the Universe,
the number of times this creature has asked the stars to send
their warmest light is exactly the same as the number of times
the stars twinkle in the sky of that strange, far-away planet.

So every time you see a star flicker when you look into the night sky,
you can feel a little warmer knowing you're sharing the light of a little creature
dreaming it's warm dreams out among the stars.
