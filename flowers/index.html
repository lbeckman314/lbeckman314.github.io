-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

Class, you really worked hard today. (You can say that again!)

Okay...
Class, you really worked hard today.

Now that the school day is through.
I've got something special for you. (I hope it's ice cream!)

Just a little homework, tonight!
Just a little homework, tonight!
Just a little homework, tonight!
Just a little homework, tonight!
(Yeah) 

Read 19 chapters of history.
List 63 adverbs alphabetically! (Neatness counts!)
Chart the journey that Balboa took
Do the first thousand problems in your new math book...

Just a little homework, tonight! (That's a lot of homework!)
Just a little homework, tonight!
Just a little homework, tonight!
Just a little homework, tonight!

Write about global warming for extra credit (Global what?!)
Check the spelling, don't forget to edit!

Tomorrow's going to be another day
that's when you get to hear me say...

Just a little homework, tonight! (That's a lot of homework!)
Just a little homework, tonight!
Just a little homework, tonight!
Just a little homework, tonight!

Buster, pay attention! (Why, i, i, i...)

There's a quiz tomorrow! (I think I'm going to die-i-i-i...)

Just a little homework tonight...
Just a little homework tonight...
Just a little homework tonight...
